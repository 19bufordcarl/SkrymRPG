# GM Rules Overview

These are rules classically spelled out in the GM's Rule Book rather the Player's Rule Book in the "5.2 SRD" rules and similar systems. There are many options and flexibilities provided, and this document details which options best fit the world of Skrym as the author would run it.

## Inspiration

This project takes heavy inspiration from the Lazy DMG by Mike Shea, and follow many of his philosophies for running RPGs. You can read on his style [here](https://slyflourish.com/) if you are curious.

## Experience Points

I use milestone XP. At the end of each session, the GM awards each PC a number of XP points between 1-10. When PCs reach 10 XP, they can level up reset their XP to 0 the next time they have a period of a week or more in a safe place with a tutor or other way to gain more power.

On average, it is expected that the GM awards roughly 3 XP per session. This might be higher at lower levels, but lower at higher levels. Ultimately, it is up to the GM and PCs for the pace of play they desire.

## Monsters

I use a wide variety of 3rd party Monsters. And I use static Initiative for monsters. Instead of legendary resistances, I use [Sly Flourish's Dreadful Blessings](https://slyflourish.com/dreaded_blessings.html).

## Maps (No Grids)

I do not use gridded play, as I have found it causes more friction than it solves. Instead, I used miniatures to represent relative positioning and the distances are more rough estimates in feet, rounding in favor of the players. Generally, things are either touching; 10, 30, 60, or 100 feet away; or very far away but within sight.

### AOE Without a Grid

From the [Lazy GM Resource Doc](https://slyflourish.com/5e_artisanal_database/rules/html/Lazy%20GM%20Resource%20Docs/17%20-%20Theater%20of%20the%20Mind%20Guidelines%20(Extended).html).

- **Tiny Area:** 1 or 2 creatures (_cloud of daggers_)
- **Small Area:** 2 creatures (_burning hands_, _thunderwave_)
- **Large Area:** 4 creatures (_cone of cold_, _fireball_)
- **Huge Area:** Everyone (_circle of death_, _earthquake_)
- **Short Line:** 2 creatures (_wall of fire_)
- **Long Line:** 3 creatures (_blade barrier_, _lightning bolt_)

## Encumbrance

Encumbrance is not expected to be tracked at the pound granularity. Instead, work reasonably with the GM to determine if a PC is carrying too much for the narrative at hand. Generally, it is assume that PCs are carrying most things in their "stash" similar to BG3. For important magical items, a physical handout, like an index card, tends to work best for keeping track of who has it.

## Economy

The silver coin is the benchmark for the economy of Skrym. One silver piece is the rough equivalent of one day of standard medieval peasant labor. Magic items are not generally purchasable or sellable in the world of Skrym since the Dragon Empire keeps an iron claw around valuable magical treasures.

The following magic items are an exception to this "no shopping" rule:

- Potions, Spell Scrolls, and other consumables that are **less than** 3rd level spell powerful
	- Somewhere in the 50 to 1000 GP range depending on power level
		- _If you are feeling lucky, its 2d6 x 50 GP per spell level_
- Weapons that have a +1 or +2 property only
	- Add 1000 GP to the price for +1
	- Add 4000 GP to the price for +2
- Armor with AC higher than normal (except for shields!)
	- Provided it does not exceed
		- 19 for Heavy Armor (5000 GP)
		- 16 for Medium Armor (2000 GP)
		- 13 for Light Armor (1000 GP)

## Overland Travel

_Optional Rule_

I might use [Sly Flourish's Travel Rules](https://slyflourish.com/5e_artisanal_database/rules/html/Lazy%20GM%20Resource%20Docs/14%20-%20Wilderness%20Travel%20and%20Exploration.html) for handling this gameplay if desired.

## Death Saves

_Optional Rule_

For less heroic games, death saves can be permanent in Skrym. See [Deadly Death Saves](Deadly%20Death%20Saves.md).
