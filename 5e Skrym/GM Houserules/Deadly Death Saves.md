# Death Saves

***Optional Rule***

In Skyrim, Death Saves represent a PC's physical health. See [inspiration](https://slyflourish.com/sf_patreon_files_898123050001223/qa/?id=1586).

PCs start with 3 death save failures. Every time they level up, they may remove one death save failure. Once a PC fails a death save, it cannot be regained except by leveling up or the 7th level spell *Regenerate*. Once a PC runs out of death saves, they are dead and cannot be revived except through the narrative of the game.

A PC can continue fighting when they are at death saves. While at death saves, you are prone and cannot stand up. You can use at most one of your action, bonus action, and reaction per round. All hits against you while at death saves do not deal damage, but cause a death save failure.

## Blaze of Glory

If a PC only has 1 death save remaining, they can go out in a Blaze of Glory.

If a PC chooses to do so, the following happens:

- The PC dies at the end of this turn.
- The PC automatically Critically Succeeds everything this turn.
- The PC can propose any 1 effect to the GM to help their comrades
	- Within reason to the PCs Level and capabilities

## Narrative

In the fiction of the world with this rule, HP and constitution represent the character's endurance and combat skill instead of their health. This means when PCs are getting hit, they are avoiding most of the permanent damage through their combat experience. A hero getting slashed by the dragon's claws takes 45 points of slashing damage. A 80 HP barbarian would be fatigued from this, the slashings didn't cut them too deeply to be fatal, and they certainly didn't lose any limbs, more than a 20 HP wizard could say. Death save failures represents true long lasting physical damage.

At a certain point your scars (death saves) become too much to bear. Consider adding a scar to your characters description when they take a death save failure!
