# Magicka Potion

In the world of Skrym, magic is not free. Casting spells requires the caster consume an appropriate amount of the resource known as *Magicka* in the form of a *Magicka Potion*. The only known recipe for a Magicka potion is: powdered mithril, purified water, and some salt.

The following table shows how much powder is required for a Magicka potion to restore the caster's magical energy. You can only regain spell slots that are less than or equal to the max spell level for the Magicka potion value consumed during a Short or Long Rest.

| Max Spell Level | Mithril Powder Required (In Gold Pieces) |
| --------------: | ---------------------------------------: |
|               1 |                                        1 |
|               2 |                                        2 |
|               3 |                                       10 |
