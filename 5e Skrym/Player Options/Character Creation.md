# Character Creation

The standard 5.2 character creation process is modified in the following ways to make it easier for new players to follow, as well as allowed experienced players more dynamic choices.

## Modified Standard Ability Array

New PCs assign their ability scores with one of the following standard arrays (modified).

> *The Balanced Start*
>16 (+3), 16 (+3), 14 (+2), 12 (+1), 10 (+0), 8 (-1)

> *Looking to the Future*
>17 (+3), 15 (+2), 14 (+2), 12 (+1), 10 (+0), 8 (-1)

> *Min-Maxed*
>17 (+3), 16 (+3), 15 (+2), 9 (-1), 8 (-1), 7 (-2)

The Balanced Start will generally be better from levels 1-3, while Looking to the Future will generally be better at levels 4 and later. Min-Maxed will only be better at levels 4 and later for certain specialized characters.

## Feat

Choose any origin feat in the "5.2 SRD" or similar reference document.

## Backgrounds

Your background can be anything you want. With it, you get:

- 2 skill proficiencies
- One of the standard [Languages](Species/Languages.md) (usually chose your species')
- A tool proficiency and the appropriate tools for it if desired
- A Dungeoneer's Pack or similar relevant pack
- 50 GP

## Species

The world of Skrym has a modified list of [Species](Species/Species.md) for PCs to choose from.

## Classes

See the narrative changes for [Classes](Classes/Class%20List/Classes.md) in the world of Skrym.

### Spell Casters

Any classes that are spell casters need to use [Mana Potion](Spellcasting/Magicka%20Potion.md)
