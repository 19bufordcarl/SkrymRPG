# Species

The world of Skrym has a modified list of species for PCs to choose from.

## [Human](Species%20List/Human.md)

The most numerous and varied humanoid species in the known world. The natives of Skrym, often referred to as the Nordfolk, are one of the many cultures of humans throughout the known world. They are often known for their hardy nature, tolerance for cold climates, and fierce drinking.

## [Half-Elf](Species%20List/Half-Elf.md)

According to scholars, there used to be the old Elves. The closest other species in appearance to humans save for the long pointy ears, ethereal elegance, and unrivaled mastery over the arcane. The most written about feature of the old Elves though is undoubtedly their near immortality.

The old Elves seemed to have vanished from this world, or perhaps they were myth and never existed in the first place. While the Half-Elves of today share the pointy ears and many ethereal and supernatural abilities of their ancestors, they are far from immortal. They can live for 200 to 300 years at the absolute most. The leading theory among scholars for why the Elves seem to be vanishing is that Elves have a much harder time producing offspring than the other species in the known world.

Today, the Half-Elves, being Half-Human, are rare, but not unheard of, and given their long age often prove to be very skilled and knowledgeable in their chosen field, be it the arcane, the natural world, or martial arts.

## [Orc](Species%20List/Orc.md)

The Orcs are a physically imposing folk, most identifiable by their great tusks. Orcish societies are often isolationist, but varied in structure. There are nomadic tribes who have seldom contact with the outside world, but there are also the great Orcish cities of the Cragstone mountains renowned for their prowess in metallurgy.

## [Dwarf](Species%20List/Dwarf.md)

The Dwarves are another very solitary folk, living almost entirely underground in their great dwarven cities, mostly in mountain sides. They are far removed from the surface dwelling folk of the known world. The Dwarves are expert miners and stone masons, and are often willing to offer their surfaces to other folk, for the right price…

They are a stout folk, but with very powerful builds. A typical Dwarf would be far wider and denser than a human of the same height. Dwarvish myths state that they were forged out of the stone of the world itself in the times of creation. Likely little more than superstitious rumor, but a good analogy nonetheless.

## [Catfolk](Species%20List/Catfolk.md)

The Catfolk are found in a great many places throughout the known world taking many different shapes and sizes. They have generally always lived alongside humans and are often included in any human societies. They are, however, considerably rarer than humans. This is because their offspring do not always take the form of another catfolk. Oftentimes, they are simply born as another type of Cat. How exactly their reproduction works is a mystery to Alchemists today, but a subject of great inquiry with many competing theories.

## [Lizardfolk](Species%20List/Lizardfolk.md)

The Lizardfolk hail from the dark sprawling caverns of the Underdark. They do not often have contact with the other species, save maybe for the deep dwarves in their greatest mining endeavors. Little is known about many parts of the Underdark, as there are many flora and fauna there that are incredibly toxic to outsiders. But, from the few Lizardfolk who emigrate from there to the surface, they seem to be a very adaptable folk and generally just as capable as the other known species.
