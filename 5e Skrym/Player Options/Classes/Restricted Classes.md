# Restricted Classes

***Optional Rule***

## Class List

Player Characters can only be from one of the following classes in the "5.2 SRD" or similar. They should still adhere to the [Knowledge Infrastructures](Class%20List/Classes.md#Knowledge%20Infrastructures) framework for choosing these classes.

* **Standard**
	* Fighter
	* Rogue
	* [Mage](Mage.md) (*Half-Wizard Full Caster Replacement*)
	* Paladin
* **Rare**
	* Barbarian
	* Ranger

## Notes

This set of rules provides a lightweight way to turn any 5e game into a more classic heroic experience with fewer super-heroic elements. The characters will still be powerful and balanced in terms of raw damage per round capabilities, but their reality warping antics will be much lower and provide a magic experience closer to what one would expect in most popular fantasy media. A little less over the top than the average 5e party is capable of by character level 9.

*You would have just unlocked small zombie army by that point, rather than unlimited teleportation, for instance.*
