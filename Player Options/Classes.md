# Classes

The class abilities are the same as they are described in "5.2 SRD" or similar reference document.

The in-world reasoning provided for how that class gains abilities is different. In order to gain class levels, you must choose one of the following [Knowledge Infrastructures](Classes.md#Knowledge%20Infrastructures) that will determine the narrative for how your character is acquiring the skills they gain at level-up. They may also provide certain benefits or restrictions according to the GM as appropriate.

Skrym is intended to be a more grounded fantasy experience with [Restricted Classes](Restricted%20Classes.md).

*If you want to swap something around with these, see the [Reskinning a Class](Classes.md#Reskinning%20a%20Class) section for details!*

## Knowledge Infrastructures

### Arcane Guild

An ancient institution of academics that collect arcane knowledge in the Dragon Empire. The Dragon's limit the power of the guild to make sure they do not pose a threat to their rule, and accordingly some spells are unknown to the guild, deliberately hoarded by the Dragon's. The Dragon's are known to exert near total control over the executive management of the guild.

The **Bard Colleges** are specialized branches of the Arcane Guild. Some say knowledge is power. The Dragon's say power is power.

See [Restricted Spells](../Spellcasting/Restricted%20Spells.md).

*Often contains: Wizards and Bards.*

### Knightly Orders

Most mortal monarchs or councils have their own orders of warriors to whom they entrust their protection and military matters. As members of the Empire, their ultimately fealty is to the Dragon Emperor, but there is often a great degree of civil tensions between the petty fiefdoms, and sometimes it even breaks out into civil wars. The Emperor is largely unconcerned when the mortals fight one another, so long as his taxes and tributes remain intact.

See [Restricted Spells](../Spellcasting/Restricted%20Spells.md).

*Often contains: Fighters and Paladins.*

### Religious Orders

There are many religious orders dedicated to the various different gods in the pantheon of the world of Skrym. All religious orders are allowed within the dragon empire, no matter how questionable their deity, so long as the order agrees to and follows the "Dragon's Pact". It states that all deity's and worship practices are secondary to the one true divine authority: "The Immortal Dragon Emperor, Aldwing, God-King of All Time." Any order that doesn't agree to the pact would be banished along with its members, if they are not executed first. The ones who survive on the outskirts of civilization would be designated as cults by the Empire and enemies of the Emperor.

All orders are also subject to the same controls on spells and magic items as the Arcane Guild, though the more disparate power structures mean they are, in practice, not always as tightly controlled as the guild. Less common orders on the outskirts of society might have secret spells for high ranking members once thought lost to the ages.

See [Restricted Spells](../Spellcasting/Restricted%20Spells.md).

*Often contains: Clerics and Paladins.*

### Secret Societies

Throughout the provinces, sometimes in cities and sometimes in villages, there may be secret societies dedicated to a uniting purpose. It might be a local thieves' guild dedicated towards pooling plunder for ease of fencing. It could be an archaeological society looking for long lost artifacts beyond the purview of the Empire's tax laws. It might be a cult who refuses to agree to the, in their mind, heretical "Dragon's Pact". They may also have access to magic long thought forgotten.

*If your character is a member of a secret society, think about why they would have joined. Power? Knowledge? Justice? Circumstances of birth? If they are a member of one such society, what lengths would they go to prevent the discovery of this secret? Know that the discovery of your secret would put your life and the lives of your fellow members in great peril.*

*Often contains: Rogues, Warlocks, Sorcerers.*

### Hidden Groves

Throughout the wilderness of Skrym, there are rumored to be hidden groves of mortals who band together to exist outside the power structures of the Dragon Empire. There existence and location is unknown to the Empire, and should they learn of it they would swiftly claim its bounty as their own. Accordingly, little is known about them beside rumor and speculation, but it would stand to reason that they might have access to magic once thought long forgotten.

*If your character is from one of these groves, think about why they would have left. Is it temporary, something like a pilgrimage? Is it permanent, were they exiled? What lengths would they go to protect the knowledge of their home's location from being discovered? Know that the discovery of your secret would put your life and the lives of your fellow members in great peril.*

*Often contains: Druids, Barbarians, Rangers, Monks.*

## Reskinning a Class

Classes can be reskinned to fit into a different knowledge structure for players that want a specific roleplaying and narrative experience, but use the rules text and abilities from another class. Some examples of how to do this for a few classic cases are detailed below.

### Barbarian to "Paladin"

Say you want a character who is a big tank like a barbarian, but you want them to be part of a religious and knightly order and actually be a lawful member of society. You can easily do this by reimaging all the Barbarians abilities that are somewhat magical to have been learned through careful study of the magical traditions long passed down through your knightly order.

### Warlock to "Wizard"

Say you want a classic smart and cunning wizard who studies all day, but you really like the abilities of a warlock, particularly eldritch blast and short rest spells. You can easily do this by imagining you are part of a specific college that studies a particular tradition of magic. Instead of making a supernatural pact with a otherworldly entity, you might of studied in a specific arcane college that focus on the history and magic of the infernal fiends, and that is why you have the fiend subclass.

Optionally, I would even say you could switch the Warlock's primary ability from Charisma to Intelligence since they are both mental abilities whose primary use is spellcasting ability.
