### Level 1: Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Mage spells, which appear in the Mage spell list later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know three Mage cantrips of your choice. *Eldritch Blast*, *Minor Illusion*, and *Prestidigitation* are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Mage cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Mage levels 4 and 10, you learn another Mage cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Mage Features table.

**Spellbook.** Your arcane apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting *Identify*. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Mage spells of your choice. *Detect Magic*, *Feather Fall*, *Witch Bolt*, *Healing Word*, *Sleep*, and *Burning Hands* are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Mage level after 1, add one Mage spell of your choice to your spellbook. These spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Mage Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**Spell Slots.** The Mage Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Mage levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Mage Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Mage spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Mage, your list of prepared spells can include nine spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Mage feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Mage spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Mage spells. *Optional Rule: You may choose Wisdom instead of Intelligence when you first choose this class for flavor.*

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Mage spells.

#### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Mage spell on a *Spell Scroll*, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.
>
> **Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a level 1+ Mage spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.
>
> **Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.
>
>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Mage spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many Mages keep a backup spellbook.

### Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn't have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

### Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose to recover all your expended spell slots of level 5 and lower.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.

### Level 2: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips are more potent. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you hit with the attack roll or the target success on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes additional damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

Also, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

### Level 3: Mage Subclass

You gain a Mage subclass of your choice. The School of Magic subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Mage levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Mage level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Mage levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Memorize Spell

Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Mage spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

### Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see "Feats") or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

### Level 20: Signature Spells

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

## Mage Spell List

This section presents the Mage spell list. Any spells detailed in the "5.2 SRD" or similar document count as belonging to your Mage spell list. All magic is at your fingertips!

## Mage Subclass: School of Magic

Your studies focus on one of the 8 schools of magic. Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Transmutation, or the dark arts of Necromancy.

### Level 3: School Adept

Beginning when you select a school at 3rd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy spells from that school into your spellbook is one tenth of the normal value.

### Level 6: School Expert

When you cast a spell from your chosen school, you may treat this instance of the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot one level higher than the one you expended to cast it.

### Level 10: School Master

When you cast a spell from your chosen school, you gain advantage on any d20 tests that the spell has you make. You may also impose disadvantage on any d20 tests that the spell forces its targets to make.

### Level 14: School Legend

Whenever you use your action to cast a spell from your chosen school, until the end of your turn, you can use your bonus action to cast another spell you have prepared from your chosen school regardless of its normal casting time.
