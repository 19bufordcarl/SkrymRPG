# GM Rules Overview

These are rules classically spelled out in the "DMG" rather the "Player's Handbook" in the "5.2 SRD" rules and similar systems. There are many options and flexibilities provided, and this document details which options best fit the world of Skrym.

## Inspiration

This project takes heavy inspiration from the Lazy DMG by Mike Shea, and follow many of his philosophies for running RPGs. You can read on his style [here](https://slyflourish.com/) if you are curious.

## Experience Points

Skrym uses milestone XP. At the end of each session, the GM awards each PC a number of XP points between 1-10. When PCs reach 10 XP, they level up and their XP resets to 0. On average, it is expected that the GM awards roughly 3 XP per session. This might be higher at lower levels, but lower at higher levels. Ultimately, it is up to the GM and PCs for the pace of play they desire.

## Monsters

I use a wide variety of 3rd party Monsters. And I use static Initiative for monsters. Instead of legendary resistances, I use [Sly Flourish's Dreadful Blessings](https://slyflourish.com/dreaded_blessings.html).

## Maps

I use [Sly Flourish's guide](https://slyflourish.com/5e_artisanal_database/rules/html/Lazy%20GM%20Resource%20Docs/19%20-%20Zone-Based%20Combat.html) for abstract zone based combat. Feel free to ask questions if something is ever unclear to you.

## Encumbrance

Encumbrance is not expected to be tracked at the pound granularity. Instead, work reasonably with the GM to determine if a PC is carrying too much for the narrative at hand. Generally, it is assume that PCs are carrying most things in their "stash" similar to BG3.

## Economy

The silver coin is the benchmark for the economy of Skrym. One silver piece is the rough equivalent of one day of standard medieval peasant labor. Magic Items are not generally purchasable or sellable in the world of Skrym since the Dragon Empire keeps an iron claw around valuable magical treasures.

The following magic items are an exception to this "no shopping" rule:

- Potions, Spell Scrolls, and other consumables that are **less than** 3rd level spell powerful
	- Somewhere in the 50 to 1000 GP range depending on power level
- Weapons that have a +1 or +2 property only
	- Add 1000 GP to the price for +1
	- Add 4000 GP to the price for +2
- Armor with AC higher than normal (except for shields!)
	- Provided it does not exceed
		- 19 for Heavy Armor
			- Costs 3000 GP
		- 16 for Medium Armor
			- Costs 2500 GP
		- 13 for Light Armor
			- Costs 1500 GP

## Overland Travel

I might use [Sly Flourish's Travel Rules](https://slyflourish.com/5e_artisanal_database/rules/html/Lazy%20GM%20Resource%20Docs/14%20-%20Wilderness%20Travel%20and%20Exploration.html) for handling this gameplay if desired.

## Death Saves

*Optional Rule:* Death saves are permanent in Skrym. See [Deadly Death Saves](Deadly%20Death%20Saves.md).
