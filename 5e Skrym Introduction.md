# 5e Skrym Introduction

This set of homebrew options provides tools for players and GMs to immerse themselves in the fantasy world of Skrym, a world of dragons and tombs in the frozen mountainous north.

This game assumes you are using the [SRD 5.2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd) or similarly compatible version of 5e as a basis for your game rules, while this set of rules provides alternative rules for character creation to better fit the lore of the world of Skrym.
